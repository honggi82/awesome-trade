The 2,700 selected papers and more than 8.56 million citations show AI moving from task-specific algorithms toward general representations and large-scale pretraining infrastructure.</p>

## Scope

- Topic: AI research across machine learning, deep learning, foundation models, NLP, vision, reinforcement learning, generative AI, trustworthy AI, graph learning, multimodal learning, and AI for science.
- Period: {YEAR_RANGE_TEXT}.
- Candidate target: up to {CANDIDATES_PER_YEAR:,} papers per year.
- Final selection: top {TARGET_PER_YEAR:,} papers per year by citation count from the audited yearly candidate pools ({TARGET_TOTAL:,} papers total).

## Data Source

Metadata comes from the free public Semantic Scholar Academic Graph bulk search endpoint. OpenAlex was used only as a public concept/subfield reference for the AI topic (`Artificial intelligence`, `C154945302`; Artificial Intelligence subfield `1702`).

## Ranking

Records are filtered to the requested publication year, screened for explicit AI relevance in title/abstract/venue metadata, deduplicated by DOI, arXiv, PubMed, CorpusId, paperId, and normalized title, then ranked by citation count. The selected set keeps the top {TARGET_PER_YEAR:,} papers in each year. Influential citation count and a deterministic metadata importance score are retained as audit fields.

## Enrichment

Taxonomy, key ideas, strengths, limitations, method tags, and keyword convention tags are generated with deterministic rules from public metadata. No paid API, paid LLM, paid translation, or paid compute was used.

## Scope

- Topic: stock investment and AI-driven trading research across stock prediction, asset pricing, portfolio optimization, financial time series, market microstructure, risk, sentiment/news, and algorithmic trading.
- Period: {YEAR_RANGE_TEXT}.
- Candidate target: up to {CANDIDATES_PER_YEAR:,} papers per year.
- Final selection: top {TARGET_PER_YEAR:,} papers per year by citation count from the audited yearly candidate pools.

## Data Source

Metadata comes from the free public Semantic Scholar Academic Graph bulk search endpoint. No paid API, paid LLM, paid translation, or paid compute was used.

## Ranking

Records are filtered to the requested publication year, screened for explicit stock-investment and AI-trading relevance in title/abstract/venue metadata, deduplicated by DOI, arXiv, PubMed, CorpusId, paperId, and normalized title, then ranked by citation count. Influential citation count and a deterministic metadata importance score are retained as audit fields.

## Enrichment

Taxonomy, key ideas, strengths, limitations, method tags, and keyword convention tags are generated with deterministic rules from public metadata. This repository is a metadata-driven citation map, not a full-text PDF systematic review.

## GitHub-Awesome Skill2 and Paper-Curation Provenance

This regeneration follows `github-awesome-skill2` in metadata-adapter mode for a large citation-ranked awesome repository. The workflow inspected the local `jehyunlee/paper-curation` checkout and is configured for Zotero-free folder-source PDF staging under `{(ROOT.parent / "paper-curation" / "paper" / PROJECT_REPO).resolve()}`. Full PDF LLM review stages from paper-curation were not run because they require separate explicit approval for paid or metered APIs.
